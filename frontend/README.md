# Next Boilerplate

## About

Next.js is a minimalistic React framework that runs on the browser and the server.

This repository is my own boilerplate packed with the dependency packages used frequently when starting the Next.js project.

## Features

- **Next.js** - Minimalistic framework for server-rendered React applications.
- **TypeScript** - Superset of JavaScript which primarily provides optional static typing, classes and interfaces.
- **Sass/Scss** - CSS preprocessor, which adds special features such as variables, nested rules and mixins into regular CSS.
- **CSS Modules** - CSS file in which all class names and animation names are scoped locally by default.
- **eslint**, **stylelint** and **commitlint** - The pluggable linting utility.
- **husky** and **lint-staged** - Autoformatting code before commit.
- **Google Analytics** - Web analytics service offered by Google that tracks and reports website traffic.
